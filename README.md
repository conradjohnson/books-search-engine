# Google Books Search - GraphQL Conversion from REST

## Description

Google Books Search is a REACT application that interfaces with [Google Book API](https://developers.google.com/books) to deliver search results that a user can save in their account.  This web app uses MongoDB, ExpressJS on the backend server.  It was converted from a REST interface to now use Apollo GraphQL interface.  The front end client also uses the GraphQL query interface instead of REST routes.   Users saved search results now link to the google book store for users to purchase their books.
